            <h1>Emails have never been this cold before.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Summit is an online email service that does not track any important user data and
            ensures privacy to its furthest extent. Enforcing transparency and honesty, Summit is the
            way to go for online anonymity.</p>
            <p>Giving big companies your information isn't fun. They know your phone number, your real name, your payment information,
            your family, they know what you think and what you write or send to others. Summit fixes this problem.</p>

                <p>Summit will be hosted using DDOS-Guard, which is not cheap.</p>

                <p>I do not have a stable salary, so I can't just buy a 6 thousand dollar server right now.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In other words, it will rely purely on user donations to stay online.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The team at Summit has always been concerned about the information that we give to companies, allowing them to control us to their liking.</p>
